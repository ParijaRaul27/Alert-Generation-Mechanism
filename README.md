Actual Report to be finalized after completion of the entire project. Yet still certain parts of the project are under development.  The Python code and the dataset csv has been attached at the end of this email.

1. Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, effective time management is crucial for maximizing productivity and achieving personal and professional goals. To address this need, we have developed a comprehensive Time Management Application with an integrated Alert System. This application utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize work sessions and triggers alerts when session durations exceed predefined thresholds.

2. Project Theme

The primary theme of the project is to create a time management application that assists users in managing their work sessions efficiently. The application incorporates machine learning algorithms to predict optimal session durations based on the type of work. Additionally, it includes an alert system that notifies emergency contacts when a user's session duration exceeds the threshold for a specific type of work.

3. Project Code

The project code consists of several components:

Machine Learning Model Training: Utilizes scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier to train a model on a dataset containing information about different types of work, session durations, and alert thresholds.

Frontend Application: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the purpose of their work and start sessions.

Backend API: Implements endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and emergency contact management using Flask, a Python web framework.

Database Integration: Stores user profiles and emergency contact information securely using MySQL database.

4. Dataset

The dataset used for training the machine learning model contains information about various types of work, including session durations, alert thresholds, day of the week, time of day, and weather conditions. Each entry in the dataset represents a specific work session and its corresponding attributes.

5. Frontend and Backend Specifications (This segment is being worked upon by us.)

Frontend: The frontend application allows users to input the purpose of their work and start sessions. It also includes a profile section where users can manage their emergency contact list.

Backend: The backend consists of API endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and emergency contact management. It interacts with the frontend to process user requests, store data in the database, and trigger alerts when necessary.

6. Conclusion

The Time Management Application with Alert System is a valuable tool for individuals seeking to improve their productivity and manage their time effectively. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and integrating an alert system, the application provides users with personalized recommendations and ensures timely notifications in case of emergencies.
